Foosok wííkaamok, foosok wííkaamok aatimapiilakáhchok áátahchooton;
There was a bird living there that always helps someone around there. 

foosok oochoskon paachíkkeiílit ittofon oochoskon paachíkkiilitwííkatok, aksobaat aksobaat wííkáámon
The bird had some babies there, it had some babies in the tree living there and she kept on making so much noise

--sáhmin onkatonkáálok-- 
--wonder what was wrong with her?--

hohiichatoomóskan:
and so they looked at it:

oochoskosikon chintok imiipahchon onkáásan aksobaachitok onáámin, máámosin.
the snake was eating her babies, and so she kept on still making noise.

Mootoomóskan.
And then again it was so.

There's something happening.

Then the bird that was there disappeared, ran away (flew) and the fish, there was a fish bone, and the bird put it in the snake's mouth.

Máámóósin chintokok, illittammitoha.
And then the snake fell down dead,

Homankahchonkáhchooti.
or that's what they say.
